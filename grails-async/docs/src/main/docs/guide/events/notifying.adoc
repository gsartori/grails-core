The simplest way to trigger event notification is via the link:{api}/grails/events/annotation/Publisher.html[Publisher] annotation.

For example:

[source,groovy]
.SumService.groovy
----
import grails.events.annotation.*
...
include::{sourcedir}/grails-events-transform/src/test/groovy/grails/events/annotation/PubSubSpec.groovy[tags=publisher]
----

What the above does is take the return value of the method and publish an event using an event `id` that is the same as the method name.

If you wish to change the event `id` you can provide a value to `@Publisher`:

[source,groovy]
----
@Publisher('myEvent')
----

If you want more flexiblity then you could simulate the behaviour of annotation by writing the following code:

[source,groovy]
.SumService.groovy
----
import grails.events.*
...
include::{sourcedir}/grails-events-transform/src/test/groovy/grails/events/ManualPubSubSpec.groovy[tags=publisher]
----

Notice in the above example, the link:{api}/grails/events/EventPublisher.html[EventPublisher] trait is explicitly implemented.

Although generally the annotation approach is recommended because it is simpler and more concise, the `EventPublisher` trait does provide more flexibility in terms of being able to publish multiple events in a single method and so on.
